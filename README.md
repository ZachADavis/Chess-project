# Chess-Project
My goal was to make a fully functional online chess game.


## Installing / Getting started
Navigate to https://zachadavis.github.io
    Have Fun!

### Initial Configuration

N/A

## Developing
Here are the goals of the future and the types of functionality I plan to incorperate:

# Implimentation Goals
* Add Back-end
* Multiplayer
* AI (PvE)
* Pause (function)
* castle (function)



```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZachADavis/Chess-project.git
cd Chess-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building
* N/A

### Deploying / Publishing
The application is currently web-based. No need for install or deployment. Simply load in and play : ).

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* White goes first per the rules of chess.
* You cannot move when it is not your turn.
* Selected pieces will give predictive/available moves to choose from.
* You cannot move while in check.

## Configuration
Standard Chess board. 
At current release version no user input is taken. Simply play chess for both black and white pieces.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
