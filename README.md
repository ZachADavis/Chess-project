ODU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Web-browser Chess game

https://zachadavis.github.io/Chess-project/

Project Description
My project here will be to make an interactive chess board game that is accessible through your web-browsers. It will be the same as the orginal game that we know and love. Of course, as this is a beginners project it will not have all the functionality of the more popular mobile Chess apps you may be familiar with but my goal is to get as close to that as possible within two weeks.

Game Logic
The game will consist of an 8 by 8 grid with alternating white and grey squares.
There will be two players: Black pieces and White pieces.
Chess pieces will include a white version and a black version of the following: Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, Queen, and pawns
The player will be able to choose the starting color White will always go first.
If the player does not want to choose a color a random team selector will be in place to auto-input players into a respective team color.
The code will be written with HTML, CSS, Object-Oriented JavaScript consisting of five configuration files for easy access to changes.

The winner will be decided once one player locks the other in check-mate: AKA preventing the other player to make any moves 
Which means logic will be in place that when the players king piece is in line of fire the player cannot move other pieces unless it removes the king from danger.
Progress will be determined by the amount of pieces a player has taken from the opposition.
A player will lose if they are unable to make a move to protect the king.
A draw option will be available after a player makes the same move more than 3 times in a row.
The player will be able to choose between playing against AI or another local player in which case they will switch off each turn.

The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
Deliverables
Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term Minimum Viable Product (MVP) -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.

Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as Post-MVP Ideas. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!

For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

MVP Criteria
Play as chess normally would.
Switch off between white team and black team each time a piece is moved. Preventing two moves in a turn.
Have the ability to choose what team to play for in the beginning.
Have the ability to be randomly selected for a team if the player does not wish to choose the team.

Another thing.
Etc.
Post-MVP Plans
Add an AI PVE option so that players can practice alone without the need of a second player.
Create a ranking system that will scale the difficulty of the AI.
Maybe even making publicly accesible so players can play other real people instead of AI. Real-time match making.
