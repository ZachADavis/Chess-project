# Implimentation Goals

* Multiplayer
* AI (PvE)
* Pause (function)
* castle (function)



```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZachADavis/Chess-project.git

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* White goes first per the rules of chess.
* You cannot move when it is not your turn.
* Selected pieces will give predictive/available moves to choose from.
* You cannot move while in check.

## Configuration
